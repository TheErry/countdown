# Natural Cycles Countdown

A responsive countdown app built with Angular and TypeScript.

The user can set a title and an end date. The countdown starts from the current time and updates live in the format:

> `X days, Y h, Z m, A s`

The countdown text automatically scales to fill the screen width (single line), and both title and date are persisted between reloads.

## Tech

- Angular (standalone components)
- TypeScript
- HTML/CSS
- LocalStorage

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.8.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.


## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
